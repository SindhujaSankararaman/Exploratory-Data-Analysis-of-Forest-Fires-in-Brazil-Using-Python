# Exploratory Data Analysis of Forest Fires in Brazil Using Python

Project Overview:
In this EDA project, I explored a dataset obtained from Kaggle, which contained information about forest fires in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. The dataset spans ten years, from 1998 to 2017, and provides data on the total number of forest fires occurring in different Brazilian states.


Objectives: 
My primary objectives in this analysis were to gain insights into the frequency, location, and various parameters related to forest fires. I aimed to achieve this through data manipulation and visualization techniques using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib. 
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and was available at the path ‘https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gustavomodelli/forest-fires-in-brazil’


Key Findings: 
Based on my analysis, here are some notable findings:
1.	The highest number of reported forest fires occurred in the month of July, suggesting that July is a critical month for forest fire management and prevention.
2.	The year 2003 recorded the highest number of forest fires among the ten years covered by the dataset, indicating a need for further investigation into the factors contributing to this peak.
3.	Mato Grosso state had the highest number of reported forest fires, indicating the importance of focusing on this state for fire prevention and management efforts.
4.	Amazonas state reported a significant number of fires, with a total of 30,650 fires recorded. This highlights the need for targeted measures to address forest fires in this region and protect the Amazon rainforest.

   
My EDA project, using the Kaggle dataset, has provided valuable insights into the forest fires dataset, and these findings can serve as a foundation for further analysis or informed decision-making related to forest fire management and conservation efforts in Brazil.
